# mavmon

Coding project for my CSE 3320 OS class. 
This project is intended to get practice on how to use and handle threads.
This program simulates a train station intersection.
Only one train can cross the intersection at a time and the trains obey the right of way.
The trains are represented as threads.
I, Adam Hudson, have written the logic for the threads.
The train.h and some of the structure of mavmon.c was written by my professor, Trevor Bakker.
